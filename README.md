## What's Tungsten?

**Tungsten** is an open source alternative to Hootsuite. Created by skepfusky -- it's a cross-posting
platform that allows you cross connect, post, and share on multiple platforms, and a project
management platform to connect to other platforms such as Trello, Slack, Jira, and even GitHub
manage projects efficiently.

This is one of my ambious projects and **it's still on the planning phase**, but if you are rooting for
this project -- unfortunately, I didn't have time to set up any funding for Tungsten... yet. I
guess the only option is to request features at the moment!

## Technology stack

![Tech stack](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=nuxt,nodejs,js,ts,sass,express,redis,prisma,firebase)

The site will be built in Nuxt 3 + TypeScript; Express, Firebase for the Back-end; Redis, and
Prisma for databases.

The whole site can be used entirely as a PWA, so that means no Electron, no Flutter, no BS!
Everything in one codebase!

**NOTE:** The stack choice isn't final yet as various technologies are a subject to change
using development.

### Why Vue?

In my opinion, I chose Vue/Nuxt to be framework of choice for Tungsten because it's more
approachable with sutff like auto-imports, and easy to read HTML, CSS and JS code in a single
`.vue` whom are already familar with writing in the plain ol' three -- file whereas React/Next
can be difficult to maintain scoped CSS and can be a mess when writing back-end code.

## Installation

- Fork/clone the repo locally on your computer
- Open the project and run `yarn install`
- Then `yarn start` to start a local dev server

Installing with Yarn is strongly recommended.
